MOBILE CAMPUS ASSISTANT - README
================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

Mobile Campus Assistant is a JISC funded rapid innovation project
undertaken by the Institute for Learning and Research Technology (ILRT)
at the University of Bristol.

COMPILING
---------

This is a Java project that uses maven as the build tool:

compile         compile the source code
test            compile the source code and run tests
install         compile the source code, run tests and create
                the application WAR file

RUNNING
-------

You need to deploy the War file to a servlet container that
implements the 2.5 servlet specification.

For development purposes it is possible to configure the project
to use an IDE managed servlet container - the developers of the
project used Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ IDEA.

The source code is only configured to use a couple of
public data sources provided by the University of Bristol. For
a more comprehensive example of what is possible, please view
the demonstrator: <http://mca.ilrt.bristol.ac.uk>

The demonstrator uses licensed images that could not be
distributed with the source code.

To run the application via maven you can run:

mvn jetty:run-war
